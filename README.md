# Malam Home Assignment - Dynamic Table and Search Project

This project was developed as part of a home assignment for **Malam**. The task involved implementing a dynamic table with search functionality using modern web development practices. The development process followed a sequence of steps provided in the assignment, focusing on the core functionalities of the table and search features.

## Features

- **Dynamic Table Rendering:**  
  Displays data retrieved from an external API in a clean, responsive table.
- **Search Functionality:**  
  Allows users to search dynamically by specific fields, such as car numbers, with real-time filtering.

- **Pagination:**  
  Includes controls for navigating through large datasets with options to adjust ranges and navigate between pages seamlessly.

- **Structured Components:**  
  The project is built with reusable components such as `SearchBar` and `PaginationControls` to ensure modularity and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** with App Router: For efficient server-side rendering (SSR) and modern web development.
- **TypeScript:** To ensure type safety across the project.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and efficient styling.
- **Axios:** For API data retrieval (used where required).
- **ESLint:** To maintain clean and consistent code.

## Considerations

- **Styling and Mobile Optimization:**  
  Minimal time was allocated to styles and mobile responsiveness, as the main focus was on functionality. Improvements will be made in future iterations.

- **Focus on Core Functionality:**  
  Efforts were concentrated on creating a robust and structured codebase with clear separation of concerns, ensuring the table, search, and pagination work seamlessly together.

## Future Updates

The project is designed to be expanded as needed. Planned updates include:

- Improved responsiveness and design.
- Enhanced styling and better user experience.
- Additional features as per future requirements.
